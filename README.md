# LatteUI


## Modules

LatteUI is made of modules, that are as seperate as they can be, some are completely independant.
You are more than welcome to copy a module you need like LatteLayout and use it completely outside of 
other LatteUI stuff.


| Module | Files | Purpose |
| -------| ---------| -------- |
| LatteLayout | `src/latteLayout.h` `src/latteLayout.c` | UI Layout engine, completely independant of other libraries
